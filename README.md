# word-chain

Solution to our fortnightly code challenge, specifically [this](http://codekata.com/kata/kata19-word-chains/) challenge. 

## Installation

Clone the code, and open the folder with VS Code. If you have the [Remote: Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed (as well as docker-desktop), VS code should prompt you to open the folder in a docker container. 

## Usage

Run the Jack In command by pressing `ctrl+shift+p`, and type `Start a Repl Project and connect (aka Jack-In)` to load the interactive dev experience. Select Leiningen, then ok. A repl shoud open.

You can run the code in src/word-chain.clj by pressing `ctrl+alt+c` then `enter`
